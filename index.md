# Smart Mirror
In this project, I designed and constructed a Smart Mirror using a Raspberry Pi 4. This ingenious device goes beyond a simple reflection; it delivers real-time updates on weather, news, reminders, and more, embedded subtly into the mirror's interface. As you explore my portfolio, imagine a mirror that doesn't just reflect your image, but also keeps you informed and organized, making your day a little bit smoother.

# Final Milestone
For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Second Milestone
For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

# First Milestone
For my first milestone, I intended to set up the raspberry pi and the monitor.
The Raspberry Pi 4 serves as the brain of the project, fetching and processing data from various sources. The monitor is the channel through which the Raspberry Pi communicates with the user, displaying all the necessary information.
- So far, I have successfully set up the Raspberry Pi 4 and connected it to the monitor. I have also loaded the Raspberry Pi OS onto the SD card and successfully booted up the system. I have already installed MagicMirror², an open-source modular smart mirror platform, and am in the works of changing the UI.
- One of the significant challenges I've faced was finding out which cable was the correct one for each input and output. For example, I connected the ethernet cable to the HDMI cable which surprisingly worked but showed the most unpleasant display. I later got help and realized I had to change it to the HDMI cable that I hadn't used yet.
- To complete my project, the next steps involve physically assembling the Raspberry Pi, monitor, and two-way mirror into a single unit that maintains both functionality and aesthetic appeal. On the software side, I plan to customize the MagicMirror² interface to display useful modules, like the weather, news, calendar, and reminders.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
